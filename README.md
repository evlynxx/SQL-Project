# SQL-Project
My SQL self-training journey<br/>
<br/>
When I first started my Data Analytics jobs, I learned that SQL was such a powerful and predominant tool that any new-comer in the data field should know. Hence, I decided to take several online courses, along with self-practicing using online data sources.<br/>
<br/>
My proudest data moment was when I attempted to integrate Microsoft Azure and SQL Server into my workplace's largest project. At first, they were using Power Query, which was time-consuming and inefficient; thus, I try to think of a way to level up the process, and ended up successfully utilizing Microsoft Azure for data storing and SQL Server for data querying.<br/>
Until now i am confident in basic SQL syntax, along side more advanced ones such as pivot / unpivot, full-text index, dynamic SQL or stored procedure.
<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy working with SQL and will continue to level up my game.

Thank you for reading!
